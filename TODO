    - concept of "bigger" goals
        -- can tie "daily" goals to them, and will help drive daily goals
        -- will be easier to then graph how often i am hitting those, whem i am falling short, etc
        -- to link these to auxiliary goals via foreign key, we need to first insert an "other/default" primary goal
        -- and give all previous data this designation

    - mark goals as active/inactive
        -- this would be different than "completed"
        -- some of them might be like "won't do" type resolution

    - roll over incomplete active goals
        -- if we get 80% of the way there, it would be nice to have some ability to roll it over to the next day to finish

    - set auto repeating auxiliary goal
        -- set "meditate 10 minutes" goal every day for however many N days

    - pie graph viewer
        -- each section of pie is a goal
        -- red --> green gradient based on completeness
        -- 0 progress incomplete is dark red
        -- 100 progress complete is dark green

    - pie graph viewer
        -- once auxilliary goals are tied to primary goals
        -- it would be cool to also have this chart to address what percentage of each
        -- day goes towards what type of goals
        -- all one color per type, and then subdivided lines or w/e within that slice

    - some way to calculate "% of day accomplished" based on goals set

    - auxiliary goal difficulty (1-10?)
        -- this will help inform the stat from above
        -- more progress on more difficult goals == bigger percentage of day complete, ideally

    - calendar viewer, able to see completed goals for a given day

    - daily goal
        -- set at the beginnign of day

    - can mark progress for saved goals

    - can mark resolution of finished goals

    - way to only show goals for a current day

    - be able to input goals for tomorrow
        -- can kind of already do this with manually inputting the date
        -- would be nice to be able to type in "tomorrow", or "next friday" or something like that
        -- that honestly would be more of an improvement for interactive menu, add to that project's TODO

    - function to calculate the highest % of progress completed, and display that instead of "not completed"
