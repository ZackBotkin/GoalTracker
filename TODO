    - be able to input goals for tomorrow
        -- can kind of already do this with manually inputting the date
        -- would be nice to be able to type in "tomorrow", or "next friday" or something like that
        -- that honestly would be more of an improvement for interactive menu, add to that project's TODO

    - concept of "bigger" goals
        -- can tie "daily" goals to them, and will help drive daily goals
        -- will be easier to then graph how often i am hitting those, whem i am falling short, etc


    - calendar viewer, able to see completed goals for a given day
